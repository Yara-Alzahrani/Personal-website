            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I’m Yara Alzahrani, a junior Information Systems student at King Abdulaziz University
                 with a passion for innovation, entrepreneurship, and creative problem-solving. I thrive 
                 at the intersection of technology, design, and business, where I explore ways to develop
                  solutions that can have a real-world impact.<br/><br/>
                My academic journey has given me a solid foundation in data analysis, UI/UX design, and
                 project management, but I’m especially drawn to the potential of machine learning. I’m 
                 fascinated by how machine learning can drive innovation across various industries, and I’m
                  eager to dive deeper into this field as I continue learning and exploring its applications.<br/><br/>
                I’m always excited by opportunities to collaborate on new ideas and push the boundaries of 
                what’s possible. Whether through designing intuitive user experiences, analyzing data for insights,
                 or leveraging machine learning for creative solutions, I’m driven to make a difference through technology.</p>
